# Baseline Predictive Pipeline -- ETAI

This is the **starting point** for your semester project: a small but *complete* predictive pipeline -- every piece a real project needs (entry point, config, data loading, preprocessing, model, evaluation), just kept as simple as possible for now.

The task: predict two-year recidivism using ProPublica's COMPAS
dataset -- the data behind a real 2016 investigation into a risk-
assessment algorithm actually used by US courts to help inform bail and sentencing decisions. See `data/README.md` for the full problem description and a complete data dictionary before you start.

It has some **deliberately weak spots**. Part of your work this
semester is finding them and making them better -- see the pipeline progress table below, which tracks what changes and why as the weeks
go on.

## Pipeline progress

This table is updated after each practical class, so you can always see what changed in the pipeline and why -- it's a running log, not a fixed syllabus.

| Week | Practical class focus | Added to the pipeline |
|------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 2 | Introduction & baseline pipeline | Initial version: project structure, a single naive train/test split (no cross-validation), minimal preprocessing (drop rows with missing values, one-hot encode categoricals), logistic regression baseline, a first (deliberately simple) fairness check comparing our model's and COMPAS's own false-positive rate by race, train-vs-test accuracy reporting (to start spotting overfitting), and each run's full report saved automatically to `results/` |
| 3 | EDA + preprocessing -- diagnose the data, then fix it | `src/data_diagnostics.py` (missingness-mechanism test via chi-square + Cramér's V, domain-rule invalid-value detection, two-way duplicate check) and `src/preprocessing.py` (leak-safe category cleanup, mechanism-matched imputation with `_was_missing` indicators for MNAR columns, a deployable `ColumnTransformer`, **and** the train/test split itself, all in the one file rather than split across two) replace the old naive `dropna()`/`pd.get_dummies()` preprocessing; encoder/scaler pair (target encoding + standard scaling) chosen by an empirical grid over 15 repeated splits, checked against the runner-up with a paired comparison so the win isn't just noise; three redundant columns (found via correlation + VIF) dropped; `config.yaml` gains `diagnostics` and `preprocessing` sections -- see "Preprocessing decisions" below. Threshold-independent metrics (ROC-AUC/PR-AUC) and a calibration check are deliberately **not** added yet -- not yet |
| 4 | Preprocessing inside the pipeline + cross-validation -- evaluating a model honestly | A **locked final test set** (20%, stratified, seed 42) is set aside by `split_dev_test()` (replaces `split_train_test()`) and never scored; models are now judged by **stratified 5-fold cross-validation** of the whole pipeline (preprocessing + model) on the development set, reported per fold with mean ± std and the train-validation gap; the classification report and fairness check now use out-of-fold predictions; target encoding switched to scikit-learn's cross-fitting `TargetEncoder` (a row's own label never leaks into its own encoding), encoder/scaler set by hand in `config.yaml` (target encoding + robust scaling, reasons in the comments); **two fixes** in `clean_dataset()`: genuine `NaN`s in categorical columns were being turned into the string `"nan"` (a fake category), so 229 `c_charge_degree` gaps were never imputed or flagged -- fixed in `config.yaml` alone: `"nan"` added to `diagnostics.placeholder_tokens` (the category cleanup's last step turns listed tokens into `NaN`, after its text conversion); and it no longer drops rows -- de-duplication moved to a separate, training-only `drop_duplicate_rows()` (run before the dev/test split), so the same cleaning can run on new data where every row needs a prediction; `src/data_diagnostics.py` removed -- its one cleaning function (`flag_invalid_values`) moved into `preprocessing.py`, and the EDA-only checks (missingness test, duplicate counts) live in the EDA notebooks, not in every pipeline run; `dummy` (majority-class) model added as the floor to beat, and `random_forest` registered (sensible defaults, untuned); the final model is refit on the whole development set after CV; `config.yaml` gains `test_set` and `cv` sections -- see "Model evaluation" below |

## Preprocessing decisions

*(Written straight from the diagnosis in `Practical/W3/notebooks/01_eda_introduction.ipynb`; the preprocessing walkthrough is in `Practical/W4/notebooks/02_preprocessing.ipynb`. This is the summary.)*

| Column(s) | Issue found | Mechanism | What was done |
|---|---|---|---|
| `age` | 2.0% missing | MCAR | median impute, no indicator needed |
| `juv_fel_count` | 3.0% missing | MCAR | median impute, no indicator needed |
| `priors_count` | ~7% missing (incl. placeholder tokens) | MNAR -- tied to `age_cat` | median impute + `priors_count_was_missing` flag |
| `c_charge_degree` | 3.2% missing | MNAR -- tied to `age_cat` | mode impute + `c_charge_degree_was_missing` flag |
| `race` | ~1% missing (placeholder tokens) | MCAR | mode impute, no indicator (excluded from model features anyway) |
| `sex` | ~1.5% missing (incl. placeholder tokens) | MCAR | mode impute, no indicator needed |
| `age`, `decile_score`, `juv_fel_count`, `priors_count` | invalid values (out-of-range or negative) | domain rule | converted to `NaN` before imputation |
| `sex` / `race` / `c_charge_degree` / `score_text` | inconsistent category spelling (casing, whitespace, abbreviations) | data entry | canonicalized to one spelling per category |
| whole rows | 72 exact-duplicate rows, all sharing a repeated `id` | data entry | dropped, kept first occurrence |
| `prior_offenses`, `age_in_months`, `juvenile_total` | redundant with other columns (correlation r=1.00, or -- for `juvenile_total` -- an exact sum caught only by VIF) | multicollinearity | dropped |

**Encoder/scaler pair:** chosen by hand in `config.yaml` -- **target encoding** (compact, informative and **robust scaling** (median/IQR, so the few extreme counts don't set the scale). The alternatives (`onehot`/`ordinal`/`count`, `none`/`standard`/`minmax`) are one config change away.


## Environment setup

You only need to do this once per machine.

### macOS / Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv                 # creates an isolated Python environment in a folder called "venv"
source venv/bin/activate             # activates it -- packages install here, not system-wide, and stay out of your other projects
pip install -r requirements.txt      # installs the exact packages this project needs, into that environment
```

### Windows -- PowerShell
```powershell
python -m venv venv                  # creates an isolated Python environment in a folder called "venv"
venv\Scripts\activate                # activates it -- packages install here, not system-wide, and stay out of your other projects
pip install -r requirements.txt      # installs the exact packages this project needs, into that environment
```
If PowerShell blocks the activation script, run this once first:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

### Windows -- cmd.exe
Same three steps as above, just with cmd's own activation command:
```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the environment is active you'll see `(venv)` at the start of your prompt. To leave it later, run `deactivate` (same command on every OS).

### Every time after the first

Creating the environment and installing packages only needs to happen once, ever. Every other time you sit down to work -- a new terminal window, the next practical class, tomorrow -- you don't repeat any of the steps above. From the project's root folder, you just need to:

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

**Windows**
```powershell
venv\Scripts\activate
python main.py
```

That's it -- activate, then run. If you don't see `(venv)` at the start of your prompt, the environment isn't active and `python main.py` may use the wrong Python (or fail to find a package) entirely.

## Environment Troubleshooting

Two Windows issues come up often enough to note here -- if you hit either, this saves you re-diagnosing it from scratch.

**PowerShell blocks the venv activation script, every new terminal.** The `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` line above only fixes it for that one terminal window -- close it and it's back. For a fix that actually sticks across sessions, run this **once**, instead:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
If it still doesn't stick (common on locked-down school/lab machines with a Group Policy that resets it on every logon), skip PowerShell entirely: use **Git Bash** (`source venv/Scripts/activate`) or **cmd.exe** (`venv\Scripts\activate.bat`) instead -- neither is affected by PowerShell's execution policy.

**Windows blocks the terminal/Python from reading or writing files in Documents (or Desktop/Pictures).** Shows up as an "Access is denied" error, or a silent failure to create/update a file, only when the project sits inside one of those folders. Two independent settings can cause this -- check both:
- **Windows Security -> Virus & threat protection -> Manage ransomware protection** -- turn off **Controlled folder access**, or add your terminal/Python/editor to its allowed-apps list.
- **Settings -> Privacy & security -> File system** -- make sure the terminal/Python has access.

## Running the pipeline

With the environment active (see above), from the project's root
folder, on any OS:
```bash
python main.py
```

This loads `config.yaml`, diagnoses and cleans the data (week 3), locks the final test set away, cross-validates preprocessing + model on the development set (week 4), and prints:
- **a per-fold cross-validation table** -- train and validation accuracy for each of the 5 folds, the gap between them, and their mean ± std. Comparing train and validation is how you catch overfitting: if the model looks much better on the data it was trained on than on data it's never seen, it has memorised rather than learned something that generalises.
- a classification report on the out-of-fold predictions
- a false-positive-rate-by-race comparison between our model and COMPAS's own score (same rows)
- the final model -- the same pipeline refit on all development rows (CV estimated how good it is; this is the model itself)
- a reminder of how many rows are in the locked test set -- which is **not** evaluated

All of this is also saved to a timestamped file in `results/` (e.g.`results/run_20260916_143012.txt`), so it doesn't just scroll past in your terminal -- open it later, or change something in `config.yaml` (like the model type) and compare the new file to the last one.
`results/` is created automatically the first time you run the
pipeline, and isn't tracked in git (see `.gitignore`) since it's
generated output, not source.

You're free to improve on this structure or restructure it entirely -- what matters is that your project stays runnable end-to-end with a single command, and that each piece (data, preprocessing, model, evaluation) stays easy to find and change independently.

## Push to GitHub via Terminal

Standard workflow, from the project's root folder, with the venv active:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "short description of what changed"
git push
```

**If `git push` asks for a password and rejects your normal GitHub password:** GitHub no longer accepts account passwords for git over HTTPS -- you need a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** instead.
1. On GitHub: **Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Tokens (classic)** -> **Generate new token**, with at least `repo` scope.
2. When `git push` prompts for a password, paste the token instead (username stays your GitHub username).
3. So you're not asked every time: `git config --global credential.helper manager` (Windows, usually already set up by Git for Windows) or `git config --global credential.helper store` (caches it in plaintext -- fine on a personal machine, not a shared one).

Alternative: set up an SSH key once (`ssh-keygen -t ed25519`, then add the public key under **GitHub -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys**) and use the repo's SSH remote URL (`git@github.com:...`) instead of HTTPS -- no token to manage or renew.

## Dataset

See `data/README.md`.

## Model evaluation

Models were evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation on
5,771 development rows. The same folds were used for all four models.
Preprocessing was fitted inside each fold. The final test set
(1,443 rows) was kept aside and was not evaluated during these runs.

| Model | Historical holdout accuracy | CV accuracy (mean ± std) | CV train–val gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dummy | Not recorded | 0.549 ± 0.000 | ≈ 0.000 |
| Logistic regression | 0.657* | 0.672 ± 0.013 | +0.003 |
| Decision tree | Not recorded | 0.610 ± 0.018 | +0.085 |
| Random forest | — | 0.650 ± 0.018 | +0.083 |

*The historical logistic regression result comes from
`results/run_20260922_193822.txt`. Its preprocessing settings were
not recorded in the log, so it cannot be confirmed as the Week 3
recipe. Missing historical results are reported explicitly.

### Interpretation

I trust the cross-validation estimate more than a single holdout score
because it evaluates the pipeline across five splits and reports
variation between folds.
Logistic regression achieved the highest mean validation accuracy
(0.672) and the smallest train–validation gap among the learned models
(0.003), so I retained it in config.yaml.
Decision tree and random forest had larger gaps (0.085 and 0.083),
indicating more overfitting under the current settings.
The historical logistic regression holdout accuracy was 0.657, but
the difference from the current CV score cannot be attributed solely
to cross-validation because preprocessing also changed.
Since only one historical model result was saved, I cannot verify
whether the earlier best-model ranking remained unchanged.

## Preprocessing experiment: median vs mean imputation

I compared median and mean imputation for numeric features using
logistic regression. All other settings were unchanged, including
the five cross-validation folds (random_state: 42).

| Numeric imputation | CV accuracy (mean ± std) | CV train–val gap |
|---|---|---|
| Median | 0.672 ± 0.013 | +0.003 |
| Mean | 0.672 ± 0.013 | +0.003 |

Changing from median to mean imputation produced small changes in
individual fold scores, but no improvement at the reported precision.
Both methods achieved the same rounded mean accuracy, standard
deviation and train–validation gap.
This experiment therefore provides no evidence that mean imputation
improves the current pipeline.
I retained median imputation because it is less sensitive to extreme
numeric values.
The locked test set was not evaluated.
